While copying and pasting code is an easy way to ensure that said code executes repeatedly, that additional code can make the program harder to read, and any changes that need to be made to the code then have to be made to each copy of that code. Instead, most coding languages support **loops**, or control structures that allow blocks of code to be repeated more than once."
