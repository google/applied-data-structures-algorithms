For instance, `5 % 3` is equal to 2, the remainder of `5 // 3` (where `//` is the integer division operator, equal to the greatest integer less than or equal to `5/3`). We can use that to create a way to determine if a number is even or odd, as any integer % 2 is either 0 (no remainder, so it is even) or 1 (it is odd). Use this to fill in an `odd_or_even` function that, given a number, will print `'even'` or `'odd'`. \n",
