In practice, list-backed priority queues tend to be less efficient since they require you to continually copy the `element_list`. This process can be costly, especially for longer lists. You also have to search through the list for the correct priority every time. Even sorting, at that point, is expensive. The major disadvantage to using a linked list-backed priority queue is that it's significantly more difficult to write. It will require more developer time to develop and be more challenging to maintain."
